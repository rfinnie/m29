You must set up a database and schema for M29 to use.  For information 
about how to connect M29 to the database, see config.sample.php.

All package suggestions here assume a Debian-based OS; please consult 
your OS's documentation if you are not using a Debian-based OS.

== SQLite 3 ==
The simplest to set up.  This require the "pdo_sqlite" PHP module 
(php5-sqlite package), and the command line tools sqlite3 (sqlite3 
package) to apply the schema:

CREATE TABLE urls (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at BIGINT NOT NULL,
  accessed_at BIGINT,
  hits BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  encrypted_url BLOB NOT NULL,
  first_key BLOB NOT NULL
);

Note that apparently PRIMARY KEY will not autoincrement when set to 
BIGINT, so INTEGER is set above.  This limits you to 2,147,483,647 
entries.  (If you're hitting that limit, SQLite is probably not the 
best solution anyway.)

== MySQL ==
Requires the "pdo_mysql" and a (php5-mysql package) and a functional 
MySQL server/client.

CREATE TABLE urls (
  id bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  created_at bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  accessed_at bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL,
  hits bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  encrypted_url varbinary(2048) NOT NULL,
  first_key binary(8) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

== PostgreSQL ==
Requires the "pdo_pgsql" and a (php5-pgsql package) and a functional 
PostgreSQL server/client.
