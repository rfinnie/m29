M29, a secure URL shortener
By Ryan Finnie <ryan@finnie.org>

REQUIREMENTS

M29 requires PHP 5 (posibly 5.2.0) or later, a functional database 
(SQLite 3, MySQL or PostgreSQL) with the appropriate PHP PDO driver, 
and an Apache server with mod_rewrite enabled (there is a way to make 
ugly URLs without mod_rewrite enabled, but it is unsupported).  The 
API server interface requires PHP 5.2.0 with the json libraries 
(json_encode) enabled.

INSTALLATION

1. Extract the files to the appropriate directory (ideally the root of 
the vhost, since you want the generated URLs as short as possible).

2. Copy htaccess.sample to .htaccess, and modify if needed.  (The 
defaults should be fine.)

3. Copy config.sample.php to config.php and edit.  At the very least, 
you will need to set up a database and populate the schema.  See the 
comments in config.php and README-databases for more information.

4. Go to the vhost and test.  You should now be able to submit and 
retrieve URLs.

5. If you would like to customize index.php, view the file for 
information on how to do this safely.
